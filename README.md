# rambles
Sometimes I just want to write stuff down and share it to the world, but like, not on a traditional social media. This repository exists for that.

There are 2 folder types here:
- `\maintained` contains writings that will actually be updated. Most relevant information about me is in this folder.
- `\2024`, etc. contains a given year's rambles. This folder will then have files in the format `{month number}-{day}_{name}` (ex. 8-30_Sample text).

Don't expect any degree of consistency from what I write here.

Don't use anything here to train AI without explicit written permission from myself. (Open a GitHub issue with contact info if you want to.)
