**Online:** I am actively on my computer and available!
**Mobile:** On my phone. Can look at quick things.
**Away:** I probably left Discord on my phone open before putting it in my pocket. Treat as offline unless I respond.
**Do Not Disturb:** I'm doing something sensitive to audio, or want to keep Discord open without it being a distraction. I don't use this much.
**Offline:** Not on at all.

I'm fine with pings and DMs, but PLEASE do so with some reason behind it!
 - Reply pings are a valid reason unless in immediate conversation.
 - Responding to me is a valid reason.
 - Immediately asking a question is a valid reason. DMing me "hi", "can I ask you something", etc. is not.
 - These matter less for friends. You'll know if you are one.

I do not have push notifications enabled on any platform! If something is urgent, I do check my phone periodically, but I cannot guarantee immediate responses.
