As of writing this, later today I'll be visiting my college's tabletop roleplaying games (read: Dungeons and Dragons) club's intro meeting. I kinda just wanted to use that as a cue to actually talk about my experience with DND, because it's honestly kinda strange.

I have never played DND. Despite that, I have experience with it. Let me explain.

Back when I was like...15? maybe 16? I was pretty into [Wings of Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_of_Fire_(novel_series)) roleplaying. I kinda just found it fun at the time - even though I was pretty bad at telegraphing my characters' inner thoughts, it was at least cool to be in the dragons' world, even if for a moment. (I still have a main WoF-based character, even if I've largely left the community.) One of the main servers I was in [which will go unnamed for reasons outside the scope of this ramble] generally had 2 sections to it. There was just your normal everyday pretty open Discord roleplay setting, nothing special there...or there were a series of quests run by one of the admins. These generally had you take a character you had to some other weird place, fight (or talk) through enemies, and eventually get a reward at the end.

Dungeons and Dragons is, to my knowledge, a tabletop roleplaying game where you take a character you had (or just made) to some fantasy place, fight (or talk) through enemies, and get rewards for that character through gameplay.

Sounds familiar? The cherry on top: the WoF server used dice-based combat. They had a bot with multiple kinds of attacks with 20 different (internal) outcomes, as well as just `!d20` to get a random number between 1 and 20.

Yeah so I was literally just playing DND without knowing what DND was at the time lol

This gets deeper, too! At one point, I myself ran a quest - or, in practical terms, I was the DM. I DMed before playing DND. Separately, at one point, I had somehow become the one put in charge of balancing the various dragon attacks (Wings of Fire has a lot more dragon types than just big, red, breathes fire), and while I definitely did not know what the actual rolls generally meant in DND proper, the main quest admin liked my balancing, I think!

I should mention that, over this, I didn't have a good idea on what DND even was. I may have heard the name, but I didn't know what it really played like.

Anyway, fast forward to [the JaidenAnimations video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQx7q6mwkV4), which reminded me of the game. By this point I had long left that server and somewhat left the WoF community (for completely unrelated reasons outside of my control). I think by this point I had gained a better understanding of what DND was from just being in more communities. I had actually commented on that video:

> DND interests me because I want to experience this [note 1] but I am also incredibly uncreative and struggle with roleplaying (mostly if the character is especially different from myself)

At the time, I hadn't realized everything I mentioned above, though it didn't take me long to put it together (the video released October 14, 2023; I had sent a message in a personal server pointing out that I have actually somewhat played it in that way on the 17th of that same month). DND kinda just stuck around in my head for a few months as an idea for sometime, until a friend I had made over a pre-orientation trip to my college pointed out that the club would probably exist at the school and that she would join it. I figured that was a good enough introduction to the game, so I decided I probably would as well.

And now we're at the present.

I feel like I could've wrote more but I did not expect writing like this to be so draining LOL

I'll try to write 1 of these per week? Keep the muscles trained so I can make these actually have some better substance
